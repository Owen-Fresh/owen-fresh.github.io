            The original Street Fighter, and the originator of the “Shoto” playstyle, also known as how the main characters of many fighting games play. A practitioner of Shotokan Karate, he seeks worthy opponents and becoming a greater fighter, whilst fighting off the “Satsui no Hado,” the killing intent that corrupted the brother of his master. As of Street Fighter 6, he has achieved a form of enlightenment in the Power of Nothingness and is now considered at peace, spending his time meditating at Genbu Temple. He and his series have set the standard for fighting games and all that followed, while still thriving to this day.
