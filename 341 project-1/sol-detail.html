            The original Gear of the Guilty Gear series, Sol was recently able to ascend from being part of the niche originator of the anime fighter subgenre to mainstream within the FGC with the release of Guilty Gear Strive, a game that has managed to chart numbers comparable to the “Big 3” of fighting games (Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat). After being betrayed by his colleague and best friend, Asuka, he seeks to protect the world from Gears, engineered bioweapons that he helped create and became the prototype for. His lore goes much deeper than that, but there is only so much time in the day.
